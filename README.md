Hello! I'm Apurva Dange, a Master of Science student in Management of Technology at Arizona State University, specializing in technology innovation and entrepreneurship. I bring a rich background in engineering and a strong passion for technology-driven solutions.

👨‍💻 Proficient in Python, C/C++, and Shell Scripting, I have extensive experience with Microsoft Azure, AWS, and automation technologies. My professional journey includes roles as a Software QA Engineer at ChargePoint and a Cloud Intern at Microsoft, where I developed key projects like the "Azure Edu-Chatbot: DevOps Master".
