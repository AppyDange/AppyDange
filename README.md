As a Product Manager with a background in software QA and data analytics, I'm passionate about building solutions that simplify workflows and create measurable value. My "why" was sparked by seeing how modern AI tools could transform healthcare delivery and that's what I'm focused on.

### 🚀 What You'll Find Here

This GitHub is my digital notebook and builder's space. It's where I follow my curiosity, try out new AI tools, and sketch product ideas. My LinkedIn is for my professional story; this is for the hands-on exploration.

Here you'll find projects and code related to:

* 🤖 **Agentic AI for Product Managers:** Exploring new AI/LLM workflows for Product Managers (PS: This is my personal toolkit).
* 🤖 **AI Product Prototyping:** Exploring new AI/LLM tools and building small MVPs (like my AI travel planner, **Anna.ai**).
* 📊 **Data-Driven Insights:** Scripts and notebooks (Python, SQL) for analyzing data and finding the story *behind* the numbers.
* 🏥 **HealthTech Innovation:** Experiments and research focused on simplifying healthcare workflows and improving usability.
* ⚙️ **Product Frameworks:** Notes and analyses on strategy, disruptive innovation, and systemic design from my coursework.

### 💼 Professional Snapshot
